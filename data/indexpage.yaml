  Distributed tracing observability platforms, such as Jaeger, are essential for modern software applications that are architected as microservices. Jaeger maps the flow of requests and data as they traverse a distributed system. These requests may make calls to multiple services, which may introduce their own delays or errors. Jaeger connects the dots between these disparate components, helping to identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot errors, and improve overall application reliability. Jaeger is 100% open source, cloud native, and infinitely scalable.
