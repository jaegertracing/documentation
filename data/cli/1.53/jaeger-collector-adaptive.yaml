        Determines how far back the most recent state is. Use this if you want to add some buffer time for the aggregation to finish.
    - name: sampling.delta-tolerance
      default_value: "0.3"
      usage: |
        The acceptable amount of deviation between the observed samples-per-second and the desired (target) samples-per-second, expressed as a ratio.
    - name: sampling.follower-lease-refresh-interval
      default_value: 1m0s
      usage: The duration to sleep if this processor is a follower.
    - name: sampling.initial-sampling-probability
      default_value: "0.001"
      usage: The initial sampling probability for all new operations.
    - name: sampling.leader-lease-refresh-interval
      default_value: 5s
      usage: |
        The duration to sleep if this processor is elected leader before attempting to renew the lease on the leader lock. This should be less than follower-lease-refresh-interval to reduce lock thrashing.
    - name: sampling.min-samples-per-second
      default_value: "0.016666666666666666"
      usage: The minimum number of traces that are sampled per second.
    - name: sampling.min-sampling-probability
      default_value: "1e-05"
      usage: The minimum sampling probability for all operations.
    - name: sampling.target-samples-per-second
      default_value: "1"
      usage: The the global target rate of samples per operation.
    - name: span-storage.type
      usage: |
