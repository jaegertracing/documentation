synopsis: generate the autocompletion script for zsh
description: |2

  Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

  If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
  to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

  $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  To load completions for every new session, execute once:
  # Linux:
  $ jaeger-agent completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_jaeger-agent"
  # macOS:
  $ jaeger-agent completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_jaeger-agent

  You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
