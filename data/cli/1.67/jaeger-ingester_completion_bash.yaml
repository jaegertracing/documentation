synopsis: Generate the autocompletion script for bash
description: |
    Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

    This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
    If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

    To load completions in your current shell session:

    	source <(jaeger-ingester completion bash)

    To load completions for every new session, execute once:

    #### Linux:

    	jaeger-ingester completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/jaeger-ingester

    #### macOS:

    	jaeger-ingester completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/jaeger-ingester

    You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
