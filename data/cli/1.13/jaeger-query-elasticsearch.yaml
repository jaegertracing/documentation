    The http port for the admin server, including health check, /metrics, etc.

  usage: |
    Configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, or Java properties formats (default none). See spf13/viper for precedence.

  usage: Salt used when hashing trace id for downsampling.
- name: downsampling.ratio
  default_value: "1"
  usage: |
    Ratio of spans passed to storage after downsampling (between 0 and 1), e.g ratio = 0.3 means we are keeping 30% of spans and dropping 70% of spans; ratio = 1.0 disables downsampling.

  usage: |
    The number of requests that can be enqueued before the bulk processor decides to commit
- name: es-archive.bulk.flush-interval
  default_value: 0s

    A time.Duration after which bulk requests are committed, regardless of other thresholds. Set to zero to disable. By default, this is disabled.

    The number of bytes that the bulk requests can take up before the bulk processor decides to commit
- name: es-archive.bulk.workers

- name: es-archive.enabled

    Optional prefix of Jaeger indices. For example "production" creates "production-jaeger-*".

    (experimental) Optional path to a file containing tag keys which will be stored as object fields. Each key should be on a separate line.
