synopsis: Help about environment variables.
description: "\nAll command line options can be provided via environment variables by converting\ntheir names to upper case and replacing punctuation with underscores. For example:\n\ncommand line option                 environment variable\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n--cassandra.connections-per-host    CASSANDRA_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST\n--metrics-backend                   METRICS_BACKEND\n\nThe following configuration options are only available via environment variables:\n\nSPAN_STORAGE_TYPE string         The type of backend [cassandra, opensearch, elasticsearch, memory, kafka, badger, blackhole, grpc-plugin] used for trace storage. Multiple backends can be specified as comma-separated list, e.g. \"cassandra,elasticsearch\" (currently only for writing spans). Note that \"kafka\" is only valid in jaeger-collector; it is not a replacement for a proper storage backend, and only used as a buffer for spans when Jaeger is deployed in the collector+ingester configuration.  (default \"cassandra\")\n\nDEPENDENCY_STORAGE_TYPE string   The type of backend used for service dependencies storage. (default \"${SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE}\")\n\nSAMPLING_CONFIG_TYPE string      The method [file, adaptive] used for determining the sampling rates served to clients configured with remote sampling enabled. \"file\" uses a periodically reloaded file and \"adaptive\" dynamically adjusts sampling rates based on current traffic.  (default \"file\")\n\nSAMPLING_STORAGE_TYPE string     The type of backend [cassandra, memory, badger] used for adaptive sampling storage when adaptive sampling is enabled via SAMPLING_CONFIG_TYPE. \n\nMETRICS_STORAGE_TYPE string      The type of backend [prometheus] used as a metrics store with Service Performance Monitoring (https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/spm/). \n\n"
