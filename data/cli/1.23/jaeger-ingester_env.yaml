synopsis: Help about environment variables.
description: |2+

  All command line options can be provided via environment variables by converting
  their names to upper case and replacing punctuation with underscores. For example:

  command line option                 environment variable
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  --cassandra.connections-per-host    CASSANDRA_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST
  --metrics-backend                   METRICS_BACKEND

  The following configuration options are only available via environment variables:

  SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE string         The type of backend [cassandra, elasticsearch, memory, kafka, badger, grpc-plugin] used for trace storage. Multiple backends can be specified as comma-separated list, e.g. "cassandra,elasticsearch" (currently only for writing spans). Note that "kafka" is only valid in jaeger-collector; it is not a replacement for a proper storage backend, and only used as a buffer for spans when Jaeger is deployed in the collector+ingester configuration.  (default "cassandra")

  DEPENDENCY_STORAGE_TYPE string   The type of backend used for service dependencies storage. (default "${SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE}")

options:
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for env

- jaeger-ingester - Jaeger ingester consumes from Kafka and writes to storage.
