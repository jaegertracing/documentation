# How to Contribute to Jaeger Documentation

We'd love your help!

General contributing guidelines are described in [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md).

This document provides documentation-specific guidance to complement the general guidelines.

## Documentation-Specific Guidelines

When contributing to the Jaeger documentation, please ensure your changes:

* Use the active voice (vs. [passive voice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/a-scary-easy-way-to-help-you-find-passive-voice/)) to make it clear when the user has to perform an action and when actions happen automatically.
* Have been spellchecked and use proper [grammar](https://www.grammarly.com/).
* Are written in plain language and avoid jargon. Remember, the people reading the documentation know much less about the project than you do.

## Making Documentation Changes

*Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jaegertracing/documentation/issues).* Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

Once the PR is approved and merged, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will automatically rebuild and deploy the documentation site.
