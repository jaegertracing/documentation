# Jaeger website

This repo houses all the assets used to build the Jaeger website, available at https://jaegertracing.io.

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Setup

Install the "extended" Hugo binary from [hugo/releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) (use one of the `hugo_extended_*` binaries) or
use a package manager if it is available for your operating system.

>  The "extended" version of Hugo supports [Sass](https://sass-lang.org), which is necessary to build the site locally.

The currently used version of Hugo is defined in the [`netlify.toml`](./netlify.toml) configuration file.

## Running the site locally

If you want to develop the site locally, you can run a single command (assuming that you've run the [setup](#setup)):

```bash
$ make develop
```

This will start up a local server on localhost port 1313. When you make changes to either the content of the website (in [`content`](content)) *or* to the Sass and JavaScript assets of the page (in [`themes/jaeger-docs/assets`](themes/jaeger-docs/assets)), the browser will automatically update to reflect those changes (usually in under one second).

## Publishing the site

The site is published automatically by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) whenever changes are merged to the `master` branch. The site cannot be published in an ad-hoc way (e.g. through a `make` command or script in the repo).

## Contributing to the site

We strongly encourage you to contribute to this site! For more information, see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Diagrams

Diagrams included in the documentation are created in the shared [Google Slides document][slides], which supports export to SVG. If you need to make changes to the diagrams as part of a PR, please copy the diagram into a new slide deck and include a shared link to it in the PR along with the exported SVG file. The maintainers will update the master deck with the new version upon merging the PR.

## Publishing new Jaeger version

Please refer to [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) for instructions on how to release new version of documentation.

## Admonitions

There are five admonition types available for the Jaeger docs:

Admonition type | Color
:---------------|:-----
`info` | blue
`success` | green
`danger` | red
`warning` | yellow
`requirement` | purple

Here's an example:

```markdown
{{< danger >}}
We do not recommend that you do this!
{{< /danger >}}
```

You can also add titles:

```markdown
{{< success title="New feature" >}}
Jaeger now supports a new thing that you definitely want.
{{< /success >}}
```

## Link checking

You can check internal links by running `make check-internal-links` and all links, including external links, by running `make check-all-links`.

## Adding new pages and redirects

When new pages are added to the documentation, please add a corresponding entry to [themes/jaeger-docs/layouts/index.redirects](./themes/jaeger-docs/layouts/index.redirects).
