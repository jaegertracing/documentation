This repo houses all the assets used to build the Jaeger website, available at https://jaegertracing.io.

## Requirements

In order to develop the Jaeger site locally, you'll need to have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Setup

### macOS

To develop the website on macOS, you'll first need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. Once you have Homebrew:

```bash
$ make macos-setup
```

This will install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the site's static site generator, and all necessary Node.js assets.

### Linux

Coming soon.

## Running the site locally

If you want to develop the site locally, you can run a single command:

```bash
$ make dev
```
