## Announcing Jaeger v2.0

**2024-11-12**

Jaeger has had a successful 9 year history as the leading open source distributed tracing platform strongly aligned with industry standardization efforts such as OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry. Jaeger is one of the first graduated projects in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). After over 60 releases, Jaeger is celebrating a major milestone with the release of **Jaeger v2**. This is a new architecture that utilizes OpenTelemetry Collector framework as the base and extends it to implement Jaeger’s unique features. It brings significant improvements and changes, making Jaeger more flexible, extensible, and better aligned with the OpenTelemetry project.

## Introducing Jaeger

**2017-04-14**

Uber is pleased to announce the open source release of Jaeger, a distributed tracing system, used to monitor, profile, and troubleshoot microservices.

Jaeger is written in Go, with OpenTracing compatible client libraries in [Go](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go), [Java](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java), [Node](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-node), and [Python](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python). It allows service owners to instrument their services to get insights into what their architecture is doing.

Jaeger is available now on [Github](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) as
a public beta. Try it out by running the complete backend along with a sample
application, to generate interesting traces.

We hope that other organizations find Jaeger to be a useful tool, and we welcome contributions.
