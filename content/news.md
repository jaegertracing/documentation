## Announcing Jaeger v2.0

**2024-11-12**

Jaeger has had a successful 9 year history as being one of the first graduated projects in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). After over 60 releases, Jaeger is celebrating a major milestone with the release of Jaeger v2. This new version is a new architecture for Jaeger components that utilizes OpenTelemetry Collector framework as the base and extends it to implement Jaegerâ€™s unique features. It brings significant improvements and changes, making Jaeger more flexible, extensible, and better aligned with the OpenTelemetry project.

## Introducing Jaeger

**2017-04-14**

Uber is pleased to announce the open source release of Jaeger, a distributed tracing system, used to monitor, profile, and troubleshoot microservices.

Jaeger is written in Go, with OpenTracing compatible client libraries in [Go](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go), [Java](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java), [Node](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-node), and [Python](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python). It allows service owners to instrument their services to get insights into what their architecture is doing.

Jaeger is available now on [Github](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) as a public beta. Try it out by running the complete backend using the [Docker image](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#all-in-one-docker-image) along with a sample application, [HotROD](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#sample-application), to generate interesting traces.

We hope that other organizations find Jaeger to be a useful tool, and we welcome contributions.
