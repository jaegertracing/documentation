The Jaeger project regularly participates in mentorship programs via CNCF, such as [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), and [LFX Mentorship](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). As a mentee, you will have the opportunity to contribute to an open-source project while working under the guidance of an experienced mentor who is an active contributor to the project and open-source community. The mentees receive an internship stipend.
