Welcome to Jaeger's documentation portal! Below, you'll find information for beginners and experienced Jaeger users.

If you can't find what you are looking for, or have an issue not covered here, we'd love to [hear from you](/get-in-touch).

If you are new to distributed tracing, please take a look at the [Related Links](#related-links) section below.

## About

Jaeger, inspired by [Dapper][dapper] and [OpenZipkin](http://zipkin.io),
is a distributed tracing system released as open source by [Uber Technologies][ubeross].
It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

Uber published a blog post, [Evolving Distributed Tracing at Uber](https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/), where they explain the history and reasons for the architectural choices made in Jaeger. [Yuri Shkuro](https://shkuro.com), creator of Jaeger, also published a book [Mastering Distributed Tracing](https://shkuro.com/books/2019-mastering-distributed-tracing/) that covers in-depth many aspects of Jaeger design and operation, as well as distributed tracing in general.

## Features

  * [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/)-inspired data model
  * Uses consistent upfront sampling with individual per service/endpoint probabilities
  * Multiple built-in storage backends: Cassandra, Elasticsearch, in-memory
  * Community supported external storage backends via gRPC plugin: [ClickHouse](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-clickhouse)
  * System topology graphs
  * Adaptive sampling
  * Post-collection data processing pipeline (coming soon)
  * Service Performance Monitoring (SPM)

See [Features](./features/) page for more details.

## Technical Specs

  * Backend components implemented in Go
  * React/Javascript UI
  * Supported storage backends:
    * [Cassandra 3.4+](./deployment/#cassandra)
    * [Elasticsearch 5.x, 6.x, 7.x](./deployment/#elasticsearch)
    * [Kafka](./deployment/#kafka)
    * memory storage
    * certified grpc-plugins:
      * [ClickHouse](./deployment/#sidecar-model)

## Quick Start
