The main Jaeger backend components are released as Docker images on Docker Hub:

Component             | Repository
--------------------- | ---
**jaeger-agent**      | [hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-agent/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-agent/)
**jaeger-collector**  | [hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-collector/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-collector/)
**jaeger-query**      | [hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-query/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-query/)
**jaeger-ingester**   | [hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-ingester/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/jaeger-ingester/)

There are orchestration templates for running Jaeger with:

  * Kubernetes: [github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes),
  * OpenShift: [github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift).

## Configuration Options

Jaeger binaries can be configured in a number of ways (in the order of decreasing priority):

  * command line arguments,
  * environment variables,
  * configuration files in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, or Java properties formats.

To see the complete list of options, run the binary with `help` command. Options that are specific to a certain storage backend are only listed if the storage type is selected. For example, to see all available options in the Collector with Cassandra storage:

```sh
$ docker run --rm \
    -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=cassandra \
    jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}} \
    help
```

In order to provide configuration parameters via environment variables, find the respective command line option and convert its name to UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, for example:

Command line option                | Environment variable
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------
`--cassandra.connections-per-host` | `CASSANDRA_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST`
`--metrics-backend`                | `METRICS_BACKEND`

## Agent

Jaeger client libraries expect **jaeger-agent** process to run locally on each host.
The agent exposes the following ports:

Port | Protocol | Function
---- | -------  | ---
5775 | UDP      | accept zipkin.thrift over compact thrift protocol
6831 | UDP      | accept jaeger.thrift over compact thrift protocol
6832 | UDP      | accept jaeger.thrift over binary thrift protocol
5778 | HTTP     | serve configs, sampling strategies

It can be executed directly on the host or via Docker, as follows:

```sh
## make sure to expose only the ports you use in your deployment scenario!
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p5775:5775/udp \
  -p6831:6831/udp \
  -p6832:6832/udp \
  -p5778:5778/tcp \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

### Discovery System Integration

The agents can connect point to point to a single collector address, which could be
load balanced by another infrastructure component (e.g. DNS) across multiple collectors.
The agent can also be configured with a static list of collector addresses.

On Docker, a command like the following can be used:

```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p5775:5775/udp \
  -p6831:6831/udp \
  -p6832:6832/udp \
  -p5778:5778/tcp \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:{{< currentVersion >}} \
  --reporter.grpc.host-port=jaeger-collector.jaeger-infra.svc:14250
```

Or use `--reporter.tchannel.host-port=jaeger-collector.jaeger-infra.svc:14267` to use
legacy tchannel reporter.

When using gRPC, you have several options for load balancing and name resolution:

* Single connection and no load balancing. This is the default if you specify a single `host:port`. (example: `--reporter.grpc.host-port=jaeger-collector.jaeger-infra.svc:14250`)
* Static list of hostnames and round-robin load balancing. This is what you get with a comma-separated list of addresses. (example: `reporter.grpc.host-port=jaeger-collector1:14250,jaeger-collector2:14250,jaeger-collector3:14250`)
* Dynamic DNS resolution and round-robin load balancing. To get this behaviour, prefix the address with `dns:///` and gRPC will attempt to resolve the hostname using SRV records (for [external load balancing](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/load-balancing.md)), TXT records (for [service configs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md)), and A records. Refer to the [gRPC Name Resolution docs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md) and the [dns_resolver.go implementation](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/resolver/dns/dns_resolver.go) for more info. (example: `--reporter.grpc.host-port=dns:///jaeger-collector.jaeger-infra.svc:14250`)


## Collectors

The collectors are stateless and thus many instances of **jaeger-collector** can be run in parallel.
Collectors require almost no configuration, except for the location of Cassandra cluster,
via `--cassandra.keyspace` and `--cassandra.servers` options, or the location of Elasticsearch cluster, via
`--es.server-urls`, depending on which storage is specified. To see all command line options run

```sh
go run ./cmd/collector/main.go -h
```

or, if you don't have the source code

```sh
docker run -it --rm jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}} -h
```

At default settings the collector exposes the following ports:

Port  | Protocol | Function
----- | -------  | ---
14267 | TChannel | used by **jaeger-agent** to send spans in jaeger.thrift format
14250 | gRPC     | used by **jaeger-agent** to send spans in model.proto format
14268 | HTTP     | can accept spans directly from clients in jaeger.thrift format over binary thrift protocol
9411  | HTTP     | can accept Zipkin spans in JSON or Thrift (disabled by default)
14269 | HTTP     | Health check at **/**


## Storage Backends

Collectors require a persistent storage backend. Cassandra and Elasticsearch are the primary supported storage backends. Additional backends are [discussed here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/638).

The storage type can be passed via `SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable. Valid values are `cassandra`, `elasticsearch`, `kafka` and `memory` (only for all-in-one binary).
As of version 1.6.0, it's possible to use multiple storage types at the same time by providing a comma-separated list of valid types to the `SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable.
It's important to note that all listed storage types are used for writing, but only the first type in the list will be used for reading and archiving.

### Memory

The in-memory storage is not intended for production workloads. It's intended as a simple solution to get started quickly and
data will be lost once the process is gone.

By default, there's no limit in the amount of traces stored in memory but a limit can be established by passing an
integer value via `--memory.max-traces`.

### Cassandra
Supported versions: 3.4+

Deploying Cassandra itself is out of scope for our documentation. One good
source of documentation is the [Apache Cassandra Docs](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/).

#### Configuration
##### Minimal
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=cassandra \
  -e CASSANDRA_SERVERS=<...> \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

##### All options
To view the full list of configuration options, you can run the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=cassandra  \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}} \
  --help
```

#### Schema script

A script is provided to initialize Cassandra keyspace and schema
using Cassandra's interactive shell [`cqlsh`][cqlsh]:

```sh
MODE=test sh ./plugin/storage/cassandra/schema/create.sh | cqlsh
```

For production deployment, pass `MODE=prod DATACENTER={datacenter}` arguments to the script,
where `{datacenter}` is the name used in the Cassandra configuration / network topology.

The script also allows overriding TTL, keyspace name, replication factor, etc.
Run the script without arguments to see the full list of recognized parameters.

#### TLS support

Jaeger supports TLS client to node connections as long as you've configured
your Cassandra cluster correctly. After verifying with e.g. `cqlsh`, you can
configure the collector and query like so:

```sh
docker run \
  -e CASSANDRA_SERVERS=<...> \
  -e CASSANDRA_TLS=true \
  -e CASSANDRA_TLS_SERVER_NAME="CN-in-certificate" \
  -e CASSANDRA_TLS_KEY=<path to client key file> \
  -e CASSANDRA_TLS_CERT=<path to client cert file> \
  -e CASSANDRA_TLS_CA=<path to your CA cert file> \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

The schema tool also supports TLS. You need to make a custom cqlshrc file like
so:

```
# Creating schema in a cassandra cluster requiring client TLS certificates.
#
# Create a volume for the schema docker container containing four files:
# cqlshrc: this file
# ca-cert: the cert authority for your keys
# client-key: the keyfile for your client
# client-cert: the cert file matching client-key
#
# if there is any sort of DNS mismatch and you want to ignore server validation
# issues, then uncomment validate = false below.
#
# When running the container, map this volume to /root/.cassandra and set the
# environment variable CQLSH_SSL=--ssl
[ssl]
certfile = ~/.cassandra/ca-cert
userkey = ~/.cassandra/client-key
usercert = ~/.cassandra/client-cert
# validate = false
```

### Elasticsearch
Supported in Jaeger since 0.6.0
Supported versions: 5.x, 6.x

Elasticsearch does not require initialization other than
[installing and running Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
Once it is running, pass the correct configuration values to the Jaeger collector and query service.

#### Configuration
##### Minimal
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch \
  -e ES_SERVER_URLS=<...> \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

##### All options
To view the full list of configuration options, you can run the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}} \
  --help
```

See the [README](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/master/plugin/storage/es/README.md) for an in-depth overview of how Jaeger uses Elasticsearch for storage.

#### Shards and Replicas for Elasticsearch indices

Shards and replicas are some configuration values to take special attention to, because this is decided upon
index creation. [This article](https://qbox.io/blog/optimizing-elasticsearch-how-many-shards-per-index) goes into
more information about choosing how many shards should be chosen for optimization.

### Kafka
Supported in Jaeger since 1.6.0
Supported Kafka versions: 0.9+

Starting from version 1.7.0, a new component [Ingester](#ingester) was added to support reading from Kafka and storing it in another storage backend (Elasticsearch or Cassandra).

Writing to Kafka is particularly useful for building post-processing data pipelines.

#### Configuration
##### Minimal
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=kafka \
  -e KAFKA_BROKERS=<...> \
  -e KAFKA_TOPIC=<...> \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

##### All options
To view the full list of configuration options, you can run the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=kafka \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:{{< currentVersion >}} \
  --help
```

#### Topic & partitions
Unless your Kafka cluster is configured to automatically create topics, you will need to create it ahead of time. You can refer to [the Kafka quickstart documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_createtopic) to learn how.

You can find more information about topics and partitions in general in the [official documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_topics). [This article](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-to-choose-the-number-of-topicspartitions-in-a-kafka-cluster/) provide more details about how to choose the number of partitions.

## Ingester
**jaeger-ingester** is a service which reads span data from Kafka topic and writes it to another storage backend (Elasticsearch or Cassandra).

Port  | Protocol | Function
----- | -------  | ---
14270 | HTTP     | Health check at **/**
14271 | HTTP     | Metrics endpoint

To view all exposed configuration options run the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=cassandra \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-ingester:{{< currentVersion >}}
  --help \
```

## Query Service & UI

**jaeger-query** serves the API endpoints and a React/Javascript UI.
The service is stateless and is typically run behind a load balancer, such as **nginx**.

At default settings the query service exposes the following port(s):

Port  | Protocol | Function
----- | -------  | ---
16686 | HTTP     | **/api/*** endpoints and Jaeger UI at **/**
16687 | HTTP     | Health check at **/**

### Minimal deployment example (Elasticsearch backend):
```sh
docker run -d --rm \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 16687:16687 \
  -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch \
  -e ES_SERVER_URLS=http://<ES_SERVER_IP>:<ES_SERVER_PORT> \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-query:{{< currentVersion >}}
```

### UI Base Path

The base path for all **jaeger-query** HTTP routes can be set to a non-root value, e.g. `/jaeger` would cause all UI URLs to start with `/jaeger`. This can be useful when running **jaeger-query** behind a reverse proxy.

The base path can be configured via the `--query.base-path` command line parameter or the `QUERY_BASE_PATH` environment variable.

### UI Customization and Embedding

Please refer to the [dedicated Frontend/UI page](../frontend-ui/).

## Aggregation Jobs for Service Dependencies

Production deployments need an external process which aggregates data and creates dependency links between services.
Project [spark-dependencies](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies) is a Spark job which derives
dependency links and stores them directly to the storage.

## Configuration

All binaries accepts command line properties and environmental variables which are managed by
by [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
The names of environmental properties are capital letters and characters `-` and `.` are replaced with `_`.
To list all configuration properties call `jaeger-binary -h`.
