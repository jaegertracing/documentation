title: Aggregated Trace Metrics (ATM) - Experimental
hasparent: true
---

{{< info >}}
As the Aggregated Trace Metrics feature is in its infancy, it is being marked
as experimental to give the community time to provide feedback and address
issues which may involve breaking changes.
{{< /info >}}

Surfaced in Jaeger UI as the "Monitor" tab, the motivation for this feature is
to help identify interesting traces (e.g. high QPS, slow or erroneous requests)
without needing to know the service or operation names up-front.

It is essentially achieved through aggregating span data to produce R.E.D
(Request, Error, Duration) metrics.

As such, technically speaking, the term "Trace" used in the ATM acronym is a
slight misnomer, while the term "Span" would be more appropriate because these
metrics are trace unaware. ATM remains the name for this feature for historical
reasons, to avoid confusion.

Potential use cases include:

- Post deployment sanity checks across the org, or on known dependent services
  in the request chain.
- Monitoring and root-causing when alerted of an issue.
- Better onboarding experience for new users of Jaeger UI.
- Long-term trend analysis of QPS, errors and latencies.
- Capacity planning.

## UI Feature Overview

The "Monitor" tab provides a service-level aggregation, as well as an operation-level aggregation within the service,
of Request rates, Error rates and Durations (P95, P75 and P50), also known as RED metrics.

Within the operation-level aggregations, an "Impact" metric, computed as the product of latency and request rate, is another
signal that can be used to rule-out operations that may naturally have a high latency profile such as daily batch jobs,
or conversely highlight operations that are lower in the latency rankings but with a high RPS (request per second).

From these aggregations, Jaeger UI is able to pre-populate a Trace search with the relevant service, operation
and lookback period, narrowing down the search space for these more interesting traces.

## Getting Started

A locally runnable setup is available in: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/main/docker-compose/monitor.

This is for demonstration purposes only and does not reflect deployment best practices.

## Architecture

The R.E.D metrics queried by Jaeger for the Monitor tab are the result of span
data collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector and aggregated by the
[SpanMetrics Processor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/processor/spanmetricsprocessor#section-readme)
component configured within its pipeline.

It is worth emphasizing that Jaeger will only read metrics from this feature and,
as such, this feature is only relevant to the Jaeger Query component (and All In One).

## Metrics Created

Though more in scope of the OpenTelemetry Collector, it is worth understanding the
additional metrics that the SpanMetrics Processor will generate in metrics storage
to help with capacity planning when deploying ATM.

The following formula aims to provide some guidance on the number new metrics created:
```
num_status_codes * num_span_kinds * (num_calls_metrics + num_latency_buckets) * num_operations

Where:
  num_status_codes = 3 max (typically 2: ok/error)
  num_span_kinds = 6 max (typically 2: client/server)
  num_calls_metrics = 1
  num_latency_buckets = 17 default
```

Plugging those numbers in, assuming default configuration (no custom dimensions
or latency buckets):
```
max = 324 * num_operations
typical = 72 * num_operations
```

## Configuration

### Enabling ATM

The following configuration is required to enable the ATM feature:

- [Jaeger UI](../frontend-ui#monitor-experimental)
- [Jaeger Query](../cli#jaeger-query-prometheus)
  - Set the `METRICS_STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable to `prometheus`.
  - Optional: Set `--prometheus.server-url` (or `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_URL` environment variable)
    to the URL of the prometheus server. Default: http://localhost:9090.

## API

Used by the Monitor tab of Jaeger UI to populate the metrics for its visualizations.

### gRPC/Protobuf

The recommended way to programmatically retrieve traces and other data is via `jaeger.api_v2.metrics.MetricsQueryService` gRPC endpoint defined in the [metricsquery.proto][metricsquery.proto] IDL file.

### HTTP JSON

#### R.E.D. Metrics Queries

`/api/metrics/{metric_type}?{query}`

Where (in Backus-Naur form):
```
metric_type = 'latencies' | 'calls' | 'errors'

query = services , [ '&' optionalParams ]

optionalParams = param | param '&' optionalParams

param =  groupByOperation | quantile | endTs | lookback | step | ratePer | spanKinds

services = service | service '&' services
service = 'service=' strValue
  - The list of services to include in the metrics selection filter, which are logically 'OR'ed.
  - Mandatory.

quantile = 'quantile=' floatValue
  - The quantile to compute the latency 'P' value. Valid range (0,1].
  - Mandatory for 'latencies' type.

groupByOperation = 'groupByOperation=' boolValue
boolValue = '1' | 't' | 'T' | 'true' | 'TRUE' | 'True' | 0 | 'f' | 'F' | 'false' | 'FALSE' | 'False'
  - A boolean value which will determine if the metrics query will also group by operation.
  - Optional with default: false

endTs = 'endTs=' intValue
  - The posix milliseconds timestamp of the end time range of the metrics query.
  - Optional with default: now

lookback = 'lookback=' intValue
  - The duration, in milliseconds, from endTs to look back on for metrics data points.
  - For example, if set to `3600000` (1 hour), the query would span from `endTs - 1 hour` to `endTs`.
  - Optional with default: 3600000 (1 hour).

step = 'step=' intValue
  - The duration, in milliseconds, between data points of the query results.
  - For example, if set to 5s, the results would produce a data point every 5 seconds from the `endTs - lookback` to `endTs`.
  - Optional with default: 5000 (5 seconds).

ratePer = 'ratePer=' intValue
  - The duration, in milliseconds, in which the per-second rate of change is calculated for a cumulative counter metric.
  - Optional with default: 600000 (10 minutes).

spanKinds = spanKind | spanKind '&' spanKinds
spanKind = 'spanKind=' spanKindType
spanKindType = 'unspecified' | 'internal' | 'server' | 'client' | 'producer' | 'consumer'
  - The list of spanKinds to include in the metrics selection filter, which are logically 'OR'ed.
  - Optional with default: 'server'
```

##### Responses

The response data model is based on [OpenMetrics' `MetricFamily`](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/model/proto/metrics/openmetrics.proto#L53).

For example:
```
{
  "name": "service_call_rate",
  "type": "GAUGE",
  "help": "calls/sec, grouped by service",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "labels": [
        {
          "name": "service_name",
          "value": "driver"
        }
      ],
      "metricPoints": [
        {
          "gaugeValue": {
            "doubleValue": 0.005846808321083344
          },
          "timestamp": "2021-06-03T09:12:06Z"
        },
        {
          "gaugeValue": {
            "doubleValue": 0.006960443672323934
          },
          "timestamp": "2021-06-03T09:12:11Z"
        },
...
  ```

If the `groupByOperation=true` parameter is set, the response will include the operation name in the labels like so:
```
      "labels": [
        {
          "name": "operation",
          "value": "/FindNearest"
        },
        {
          "name": "service_name",
          "value": "driver"
        }
      ],
```

#### Min Step Query

`/api/metrics/minstep`

Gets the min time resolution supported by the backing metrics store, in milliseconds, that can be used in the `step` parameter.
e.g. a min step of 1 means the backend can only return data points that are at least 1ms apart, not closer.
