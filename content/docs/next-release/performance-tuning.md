Jaeger was built from day 1 to be able to ingest huge amounts of data in a resilient way. To better utilize resources that might cause delays, such as storage or network communications, Jaeger buffers and batches data. When more spans are generated than Jaeger is able to safely process, spans might get dropped. However, the defaults might not fit all scenarios.

## Deployment considerations

Although performance tuning the individual components is important, the way Jaeger is deployed can be decisive in obtaining optimal performance.

### Scale the Collector up and down

Use the auto-scaling capabilities of your platform: **jaeger-collector** is nearly horizontally scalable so that more instances can be added and removed on-demand. A good way to scale up and down is by checking the `jaeger_collector_queue_length` metric: add instances when the length is higher than 50% of the maximum size for extended periods of time. Another metric that can be taken into consideration is `jaeger_collector_in_queue_latency_bucket`, which is a histogram indicating how long spans have been waiting in the queue before a worker picked it up. When the queue latency gets higher over time, it’s a good indication to increase the number of the workers, or to improve the storage performance.

Adding **jaeger-collector** instances is recommended when your platform provides auto-scaling capabilities, or when it's easier to start/stop **jaeger-collector** instances than changing existing, running instances. Scaling horizontally is also indicated when the CPU usage should be spread across nodes.

### Make sure the storage can keep up

Each span is written to the storage by **jaeger-collector** using one worker, blocking it until the span has been stored. When the storage is too slow, the number of workers blocked by the storage might be too high, causing spans to be dropped. To help diagnose this situation, the histogram `jaeger_collector_save_latency_bucket` can be analyzed. Ideally, the latency should remain the same over time. When the histogram shows that most spans are taking longer and longer over time, it’s a good indication that your storage might need some attention.

### Consider using Apache Kafka as intermediate buffer

Jaeger [can use Apache Kafka](../architecture/) as a buffer between **jaeger-collector** and the actual backing storage (Elasticsearch, Apache Cassandra). This is ideal for cases where the traffic spikes are relatively frequent (prime time traffic) but the storage can eventually catch up once the traffic normalizes. For that, the `SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable should be set to `kafka` in  **jaeger-collector**, and **jaeger-ingester** component must be used, reading data from Kafka and writing it to the storage.

In addition to the performance aspects, having spans written to Kafka is useful for building real time data pipeline for aggregations and feature extraction from traces.

**jaeger-collector**s can still be scaled in the same way as when writing to storage directly. The trace IDs are used as sharding keys for Kafka partitions, such that all spans for a given trace end up in the same partition of the Kafka topic. Each **jaeger-collector** can write to any partition.

**jaeger-ingester**s can also be scaled as needed to sustain the throughput. They will automatically negotiate and rebalance Kafka partitions among them. However, it does not make sense to run more **jaeger-ingester**s than there are partitions in the Kafka topic, as in this case some of **jaeger-ingester**s will be idle.

## Client (Tracer) settings

{{< warning >}}
Jaeger clients have been retired. Please use the OpenTelemetry SDKs.
{{< /warning >}}

The Jaeger Clients are built to have minimal effect to the instrumented application. As such, it has conservative defaults that might not be suitable for all cases. Note that Jaeger Clients can be configured programmatically or via [environment variables](../client-features/).

### Adjust the sampling configuration

Together, the `JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE` and `JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM` specify how often traces should be "sampled", ie, recorded and sent to the Jaeger backend. For applications generating many spans, setting the sampling type to `probabilistic` and the value to `0.001` (the default) will cause traces to be reported with a 1/1000th chance. Note that the sampling decision is made at the root span and propagated down to all child spans.

For applications with low to medium traffic, setting the sampling type to `const` and value to `1` will cause all spans to be reported. Similarly, tracing can be disabled by setting the value to `0`, while context propagation will continue to work.

Some Clients support the setting `JAEGER_DISABLED` to completely disable the Jaeger Tracer. This is recommended only if the Tracer is behaving in a way that causes problems to the instrumented application, as it will not propagate the context to the downstream services.

We recommend setting your clients/SDKs to use the [`remote` sampling strategy](../sampling/#remote-sampling), so that admins can centrally set the concrete sampling strategy for each service.

### Increase in-memory queue size

Most of the SDKs buffer spans in memory before sending them to **jaeger-collector**. The maximum size of this buffer is configurable (see respective OpenTelemetry SDK documentation): the larger the size, the higher the potential memory consumption. When the instrumented application is generating a large number of spans, it’s possible that the queue will be full causing the SDK to discard the new spans.

In most common scenarios, the queue will be close to empty, as spans are flushed to **jaeger-collector** at regular intervals or when a certain size of the batch is reached.

### Modify the batched spans flush interval

The SDKs allow the customization of the flush interval used by the exporters. The lower the flush interval is set to, the more frequent the flush operations happen. As most exporters will wait until enough data is in the queue, this setting will force a flush operation at periodic intervals, so that spans are sent to the backend in a timely fashion.

When the instrumented application is generating a large number of spans and **jaeger-collector** is close to the application, the networking overhead might be low, justifying a higher number of flush operations. When the `HttpSender` is being used and the **jaeger-collector** is not close enough to the application, the networking overhead might be too high so that a higher value for this property makes sense.

## Collector settings

**jaeger-collector** receives data from SDKs. When not properly configured, it might process less data than what would be possible on the same host, or it might overload the host by consuming more memory than permitted.

### Adjust queue size

**jaeger-collector** is able to receive spans and place them in an internal queue for processing. This allows **jaeger-collector** to return immediately to the SDK instead of waiting for the span to make its way to the storage.

The setting `collector.queue-size` (default: `2000`) dictates how many spans the queue should support. In the typical scenario, the queue will be close to empty, as enough workers should exist picking up spans from the queue and sending them to the storage. When the number of items in the queue (metric `jaeger_collector_queue_length`) is permanently high, it’s an indication that either the number of workers should be increased or that the storage cannot keep up with the volume of data that it’s receiving. When the queue is full, the older items in the queue are overridden, causing spans to be discarded (metric `jaeger_collector_spans_dropped_total`).

Given that the queue size should be close to empty most of the time, this setting should be as high as the available memory for the Collector, to provide maximum protection against sudden traffic spikes. However, if your storage layer is under-provisioned and cannot keep up, even a large queue will quickly fill up and start dropping data.

Experimental: starting from Jaeger 1.17, **jaeger-collector** can adjust the queue size automatically based on the memory requirements and average span size. Set the flag `collector.queue-size-memory` to the maximum memory size in MiB that **jaeger-collector** should use, and Jaeger will periodically calculate the ideal queue size based on the average span size it has seen. For safety reasons, the maximum queue size is hard-coded to 1 million records. If you are using this feature, [give us your feedback](https://www.jaegertracing.io/get-in-touch/)!

### Adjust processor workers

Items from the span queue in **jaeger-collector** are picked up by workers. Each worker picks one span from the queue and persists it to the storage. The number of workers can be specified by the setting `collector.num-workers` (default: `50`) and should be as high as needed to keep the queue close to zero. The general rule is: the faster the backing storage, the lower the number of workers can be. Given that workers are relatively cheap, this number can be increased at will. As a general rule, one worker per 50 items in the queue should be sufficient when the storage is fast. With a `collector.queue-size` of `2000`, having about `40` workers should be sufficient. For slower storage mechanisms, this ratio should be adjusted accordingly, having more workers per queue item.
