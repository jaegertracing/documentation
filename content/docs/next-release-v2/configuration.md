Jaeger can be configured via a YAML configuration file that uses the same format as the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

We are currently working on expanding this section with more details. Examples of working configuration files can be found in the [Jaeger repository](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/main/cmd/jaeger). In the future the documentation for all configuration properties will be [auto-generated](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/6186).
