Jaeger can be configured via a YAML configuration file that uses the same format as the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

We are currently working on expanding this section with more details. [Examples of working configuration files](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/main/cmd/jaeger) can be found in the Jaeger repository. In the future the documentation for all configuration properties will be [auto-generated](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/6186).
