[Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) is a local file storage embedded within Jaeger.

See [sample configuration](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/v2.1.0/cmd/jaeger/config-badger.yaml).

## Troubleshooting

* [Badger file permissions as non-root service](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/v2.1.0/plugin/storage/badger/docs/storage-file-non-root-permission.md)
