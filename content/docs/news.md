At the [Open Source Summit NA](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america) in Los Angeles,
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](http://cncf.io)) announced that it had accepted Jaeger as its 12th hosted project.
Jaeger joins the respected company of other major modern foundational projects like Kubernetes, Prometheus, gRPC, and OpenTracing.

## Introducing Jaeger

**2017-04-14**

<!-- <img align="right" src="/img/jaeger-vector.svg"> -->
Uber is pleased to announce the open source release of Jaeger, a distributed tracing system, used to monitor, profile, and troubleshoot microservices.

Jaeger is written in Go, with OpenTracing compatible client libraries in [Go](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go), [Java](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java), [Node](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-node), and [Python](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python). It allows service owners to instrument their services to get insights into what their architecture is doing.

Jaeger is available now on [Github](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) as a public beta. Try it out by running the complete backend using the [Docker image](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#all-in-one-docker-image) along with a sample application, [HotROD](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#sample-application), to generate interesting traces.

We hope that other organizations find Jaeger to be a useful tool, and we welcome contributions.
