title: Mentorship - For Mentors

## Retrospective

We want to keep improving to make sure mentees have an enjoyable and productive time during their tenure.

During the last week of the program, mentors and mentees should prepare a document with two headings:
What we did well.
What we could do better.

Be specific, blameless and honest. Itâ€™s not about offending anyone, but looking for improvements for both Mentor and Mentees work. Be critical to yourself, but also try to balance the good and to improve parts. There is always something we could do better or worse.

Identify any learnings and/or actions from the feedback and ensure these are reflected or documented somewhere accessible, prior to the next mentorship program.
